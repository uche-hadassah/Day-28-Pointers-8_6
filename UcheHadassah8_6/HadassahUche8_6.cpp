/*Use pointers to write a void function named remove() that deletes all occurrences of a 
character from a C-string. The function should use two parameters: the C-string and the 
character to be removed. For example if str contains the C-string Happy Holidays, the 
function call remove(str, ‘H’) should change the string str to appy olidays. 
Test your function.*/
